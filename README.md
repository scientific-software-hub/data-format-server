This project is a part of [X-Environment](https://github.com/waltz-controls/xenv)  (Integrated Control System for High-throughput Tomography experiments). This Java Tango server uses [libpniio-jni](https://github.com/hzg-wpi/libpniio-jni) to write data into a NeXus file.

## Requirements ##

Due to libpniio-jni limitation this server can be run only on Debian wheezy. All dependencies of the cpp part of jni must be installed.


Have fun!
